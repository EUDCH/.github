# EDCH:â€¯European Diamond Capacity Hub

The European Diamond Capacity Hub (EDCH) is a collective that provides
services for Diamond Open Access Publishers, Service Providers, and Tools &
Technology Providers.

It takes its place alongside other regional Capacity Hubs such as
Redalyc-Amelica and AJOL, and thus provides a gateway to the global Diamond
Open Access community.

## Mission and objectives

The aim of the European Diamond Capacity Hub (EDCH) is to regionally
facilitate a globally distributed, aligned, high-quality, and sustainable
scholarly communication infrastructure that is managed and owned by the
scholarly community.

Its main role is to ensure alignment of Diamond Capacity Centers (DCCs) in
Europe. The EDCH has at least the following tasks:

- Coordinate and streamline services and practices across DCCs; implement and
monitor DIAMAS standards ([DOAS](https://zenodo.org/records/13820036)). 
- Manage a portal  for shared resources such as the outputs of [DIAMAS](https://diamasproject.eu/) and
[CRAFT-OA](https://www.craft-oa.eu/) projects
- Create efficiencies, complementarity, and subsidiarity between existing
European DCCs, and stimulate the creation of new national DCCs across Europe.
- Pool and redistribute financial and service resources for Diamond Open
Access in Europe.
- Organize exchanges of electronic publishing specialists across Europe with a
view to increasing the professionalization of Diamond OA publishing. 
- Set goals for the expansion of Diamond Open Access journals in Europe via a
Diamondisation Task Force.
- Represent Europe in the Global Framework for Diamond Open Access coordinated
by UNESCO.
